# Resume Upload Implementation

## User Request
Enable resuming file uploads in case the user comes back. When the page loads, check with `/api/resume` endpoint and allow users to continue uploading the same file if the filename matches.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (Already Implemented)
- **`/api/resume`** endpoint returns `latestUploaderId`, `lastUploadedFileName`, and `remainingCount`
- **Session management** tracks upload state across requests
- **Cleanup logic** in upload completion to clear session data

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. UI Components Added
- **Resume banner** (`resume-section`) that appears when resume data is available
- **Resume info** showing filename and remaining parts count
- **Dismiss button** to hide resume option
- **Dynamic upload button** that changes to "Resume Upload" with green styling

#### 2. JavaScript Logic Added

##### Constructor Updates
- Added resume UI element references
- Added resume state properties (`resumeData`, `isResuming`)
- Added `checkForResume()` call on initialization

##### Resume Methods
- **`checkForResume()`**: Calls `/api/resume` on page load
- **`showResumeOption()`**: Displays resume banner with file details
- **`dismissResume()`**: Hides resume banner and clears resume state
- **`resumeUpload()`**: Handles resuming existing upload using stored uploaderId

##### Modified File Selection Logic
- **Filename matching**: Compares selected file name with `lastUploadedFileName`
- **Visual feedback**: Changes button text and color for resume operations
- **State management**: Sets `isResuming` flag appropriately

##### Upload Flow Changes
- **`startUpload()`**: Routes to either new upload or resume based on state
- **`startNewUpload()`**: Original upload logic (unchanged)
- **`resumeUpload()`**: New logic for continuing existing uploads

### Resume Flow

1. **Page Load**: Check `/api/resume` for existing incomplete uploads
2. **Resume Available**: Show banner with filename and remaining parts
3. **File Selection**: 
   - If filename matches → Enable resume mode (green button)
   - If filename differs → Standard upload mode
4. **Resume Upload**:
   - Use existing `uploaderId` from session
   - GET `/api/uploads/{uploaderId}` to get remaining part requests
   - Upload only the missing parts
   - Hide resume banner during upload
5. **Completion**: Clear session data and show success message

### Key Features

#### User Experience
- **Clear visual feedback** when resume is available
- **Filename validation** ensures correct file is being resumed
- **Seamless continuation** of interrupted uploads
- **Dismissible banner** if user wants to start fresh

#### Technical Implementation
- **Session-based tracking** of upload state
- **Part-level resumption** only uploads missing parts
- **Error handling** for resume failures
- **State management** prevents conflicts between new/resume uploads

#### Styling
- **Resume banner** with purple gradient theme matching app design
- **Green resume button** to distinguish from new uploads
- **Responsive design** works on all device sizes
- **Smooth transitions** for showing/hiding resume elements

- ✅ User-friendly UI for resume operations
- ✅ Automatic detection of resumable uploads on page load
