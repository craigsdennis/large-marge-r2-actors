# Frontend Implementation for Large Marge

## User Request
Create a frontend for the Large Marge app that allows users to upload large files using multipart upload to R2. The frontend should include a form for file selection and use the existing API endpoints at `/api/uploads`.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
1. **`public/index.html`** - Main HTML page with upload form
2. **`public/upload.js`** - JavaScript handling multipart upload logic
3. **`public/styles.css`** - CSS styling for the upload interface

### API Integration
The frontend integrates with the existing API endpoints:
- `POST /api/uploads` - Initialize upload and get part requests
- `PATCH /api/uploads/{uploaderId}/{partNumber}` - Upload individual parts

### Key Features Implemented

#### Upload Process
1. **File Selection**: Users can select a file via drag-drop styled input
2. **Upload Initialization**: Sends file metadata to create multipart upload
3. **Part Upload**: Uploads file in 10MB chunks with progress tracking
4. **Concurrent Uploads**: Uploads up to 3 parts simultaneously for performance
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and status updates
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

#### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Progress Visualization**: Animated progress bar with percentage and status
- **File Information**: Displays selected file name and formatted size
- **Success/Error States**: Clear feedback for upload completion or failures

#### Technical Implementation
- **ES6 Classes**: Modern JavaScript using `LargeMargeUploader` class
- **Async/Await**: Clean async handling for upload operations
- **File API**: Uses browser File API to slice files into parts
- **Fetch API**: Modern HTTP requests for all API communication

### Upload Flow
1. User selects file → File info displayed, upload button enabled
2. User clicks upload → Upload initialization request sent
3. Server returns uploaderId and partRequests array
4. Client uploads parts concurrently in batches
5. Progress updates in real-time
6. Success/error message displayed on completion

### Styling
- **Modern Design**: Gradient background with card-based layout
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Color Scheme**: Purple gradient theme matching "Large Marge" branding
- **Typography**: System fonts for optimal performance and readability

## Results
- ✅ Complete frontend implementation for multipart file uploads
